K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier for Iris Dataset
This Python script implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier on the Iris dataset. The KNN algorithm is a type of instance-based learning, or lazy learning, where the function is only approximated locally and all computation is deferred until function evaluation.

Code Description
Import Libraries: The script begins by importing necessary libraries. These include numpy for numerical operations, pandas for data manipulation, sklearn.model_selection for splitting the dataset, sklearn.neighbors for the KNN model, sklearn for metrics to evaluate the model, and sklearn.preprocessing for scaling features.
Load Dataset: The pandas function read_csv is used to load the Iris dataset from a CSV file. The dataset is stored in the DataFrame df.
Preprocess Data: The features (x) and target (y) are separated. The features are standardized using StandardScaler to have mean=0 and variance=1, which is a requirement for the optimal performance of many machine learning algorithms.
Split Dataset: The train_test_split function is used to split the dataset into training and testing sets. The test size is 20% of the entire dataset.
Train KNN Model: A KNN model is created and trained using the training data. The number of neighbors k is initially set to 3.
Make Predictions: The trained model is used to make predictions on the test data.
Evaluate Model: The accuracy of the model is calculated by comparing the predicted values to the actual values in the test set.
Optimize k: The script then finds the optimal value of k (number of neighbors) that gives the highest accuracy.
Predict New Data Point: Finally, the script predicts the species of a new data point using the trained model.
This script demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet powerful machine learning technique. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity and makes predictions based on the majority class of these neighboring instances.
