Import necessary libraries: The script begins by importing the necessary Python libraries for the analysis. These include numpy for numerical operations, matplotlib.pyplot for plotting, KMeans from sklearn.cluster for the k-means clustering algorithm, and pandas for data manipulation.
Load the data: The script reads a CSV file named ‘Cust_Segmentation.csv’ into a pandas DataFrame. This file contains the customer data that will be clustered.
Preprocess the data: The ‘Address’ column is dropped from the DataFrame, as it’s not needed for the clustering. The values from the DataFrame are then converted to a numpy array and any NaN values are replaced with 0.
Standardize the features: The features in the dataset are standardized using the StandardScaler from sklearn.preprocessing. Standardizing the features means that they will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This is often done before applying machine learning algorithms because it can improve their performance.
Set up k-means clustering: A KMeans object is created with the number of clusters set to 3, the initialization method set to “k-means++”, and the number of initial centroid placements set to 12.
Fit the model: The k-means algorithm is run on the data by calling the fit method of the KMeans object.
Get the labels: The labels assigned by the k-means algorithm to each data point are retrieved and added to the original DataFrame.
Group by labels and calculate the mean: The DataFrame is grouped by the labels and the mean of each group is calculated.
Create a scatter plot: A scatter plot is created to visualize the clusters in 2D space.
